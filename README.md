# forecast-Long_Term_Projection_SARIMA
Long term projection of short term SARIMA estimate of raw liquidity need

1. cover1.csv data file, time series of raw liquidity need: quasi-stationary time series with periodic spikes of random magnitude
2. true_roberto.R R script
3. Liquidity_Model_WhitePaper.docx model White Paper
4. WhitePaper_Improvement_Links.txt links to further model improvement

TODO:
* Improve the model by ccomputing the distribution of the Max 
* Extend to numerical + theoretical analysis of the periodic jumps of random magnitude
